# Grayscale-Image-Converter

This is my first assignment for my Digital Image Processing class for Dr.Marques (COT 5930).  
The goal with this small project is to pass an image into a variable, display the image, apply a filter to it 
and display the new image which is my case is a grayscaled version of an image. This is the first assignment 
and a beginner level assignment.
